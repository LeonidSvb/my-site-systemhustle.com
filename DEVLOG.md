**refactor: unified assets architecture for product pages**

ROI calculator duplicated in 3 places (1108 lines â†’ 300 lines per product)  
Decision: single main.js/main.css for all pages with conditional component loading  
Result: better caching, no code duplication, faster development

**docs: created stupid simple devlog format**  

Researched industry standards - ADR/ARCHITECTURE.md = over-engineering for solo dev  
Decision: single DEVLOG.md with git-commit style entries  
Result: 5min logging vs 30min complex documentation

**feat: about me page + blog section with custom styles**

Created about-me.html with personal story + journey details  
Added blog/ section with typography-focused CSS (Medium/Substack inspired)  
Result: better content structure + improved readability for long-form content

**docs: comprehensive testing & workflow standards**

Created TESTING-CHECKLIST.md (navigation, responsive, performance, SEO tests)  
Created WORKFLOW-STANDARDS.md (daily protocols, QA standards, emergency procedures)  
Result: systematic approach to maintain site quality + prevent regression bugs

**refactor: unified component architecture - v2.0 complete**

Consolidated 1000+ lines of duplicate code into main.css/main.js + config.js system  
Refactored all pages (index, about-me, blog) to use unified assets + CTA management  
Result: single source of truth for styles/links, 90% reduction in maintenance overhead
